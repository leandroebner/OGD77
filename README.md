# OpenGD77 
## Firmware for DMR Radios

The codeplug and information available here are buiilt and intended to be used for our local amateur radio club "P09" as part of the DARC. This repository is therefore especially useful to be used within the location "JN47".

> [!WARNING]
> This repository only maintains software and code for the **Retevis RT3S** or other rebranded radios of the same type like TYTs. While OGD77 supports other radios as well, there is no plan at the moment to include other radios in here too.



> [!NOTE]
> Current local database includes `263614 DMR IDs` fetched from [RadioID](https://radioid.net).
> 
> *(As of 23.07.2024)*
